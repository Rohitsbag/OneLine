# Authentication

All API requests require an API key in the `Authorization` header.

## Key Format

```
Authorization: Bearer oline_<key_id>.<secret>
```

- `oline_` - Prefix identifying OneLine keys
- `key_id` - 32-character public identifier
- `secret` - 64-character secret (only shown once)

## Creating an API Key

  <Step title="Open Settings">
    In the OneLine app, tap the gear icon to open Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Access">
    Scroll down to the **API Access** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click **New Key**, enter a name, and select permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Secret">

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose your API key">
    Treat your API key like a password. Don't commit it to version control or share it publicly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use minimal scopes">
    Only request the permissions you need. If you only need to read entries, don't request write access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Revoke old keys and create new ones periodically. You can do this in Settings → API Access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json

  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "Invalid API key",
  "trace_id": "abc-123-def"
