## 🔮 The Problem: "The Journaling Paradox"

**The Aspiration vs. Reality Gap**
80% of people *want* to journal. Less than 5% stick with it. Why?
Because we treat journaling as a *performance* rather than a *practice*. We feel we need to write profound essays every night. When we're tired, we skip it. When we skip it, we feel guilt. The habit dies.

**The "Data Rot"**
We capture thousands of photos and texts, but they are scattered. Our digital memories are rotting in data silosunorganized, unsearchable, and disconnected from our emotional state.

## 💎 The Solution: "Atomic Journaling"

OneLine isn't just an app; it's a philosophy.

- **Make it obvious:** The app opens directly to the input field.
- **Make it easy:** It takes 5 seconds (typing) or 2 seconds (voice).
- **Make it satisfying:** The UI gives immediate, subtle feedback.

> "The best journal entry is the one you actually write."
